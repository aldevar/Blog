I was holding this back, but you know what, let's kick this hornet's nest.

Many engineers are unprepared for the autonomy and freedom they demand.

Most problems in business will not fit in your well-scoped JIRA ticket. That doesn't mean you get to ignore them until they do.

Like, lemme get this straight: you expect a six figure salary, full autonomy to solve problems as you see fit, and _also_ bite-sized, well-scoped bug reports/features.

riiiight
Most problems worth solving are vague. They are ill-defined. They contain more questions than answers. Often, it's not even clear there _are_ good answers, much less where to even find them to begin with.
People get paid the big bucks because they handle that uncertainty well and bring those vague, ill-defined problems to a good resolution.

"I'm pretty good with React" doesn't quite cut it.

Yes, because of the implication: you want ownership? Great. Here's your KPIs.

You didn't meet those KPIs? Here's your severance, best of luck at your next job.

I made a comment to an advisor a while back about "a VP on a PIP" and they laughed.

"Mike, a VP is always on a PIP. That's the role. You hit your KPIs or you're out."

Picking on @Swizec (with approval!). there's a thing that's bugged me for years re: the senior title.

You can't _possibly_ be a senior engineer a few years in. Mindset is definitely a thing. so is experience. Some of that mindset *comes from experience*

What happens when you've got the senior title at five years in? Where do you go? Super-duper-senior at seven years?
An arms race, but with titles!

It's only a matter of time until we have Senior Fellow Principal Staff Engineer with nine years of experience under their belt.

"I'm a Principal / Senior / Staff / L6 / I4 / whatever the hell Engineer!"

At one org, that's a huge achievement and incredibly meaningful. Well done!

At another, it's what they pass out in lieu of another $10K of salary. Womp womp.

Experience (and thus, seniority) can't be rushed.

Otherwise you get to be one of those people with one year of experience repeated twenty times.

I don't know how I missed this thread, but I can't agree enough with this. I never want to hear another engineer complaining I'm "mean" because I'm holding them accountable to their senior title.

Most engineer orgs I've worked with in... nobody was accountable for business outcomes. My favorite excuse is that doing so would create tech debt... guess whose job it is to make sure that doesn't happen? You. The "senior engineer".

So much this! The real business problems are messy, vague and obscure. But all the more rewarding and valuable!

Being a good senior (or higher) engineer requires the ability to convert ideas/feelings of others (that may or may not be technically inclined) into projects/tickets for more junior engineers to build.
The more up the ladder you go, the less hands-on with actual building you are.

I don't disagree with the take on title inflation and developers sometimes having senior roles too early, but I strongly disagree that the fault lies with the developer and not with companies having proper career paths for devs.

This is uncomfortable, but IME valid observation about the tech industry. HOWEVER why we got into this situation is fairly complex, and I think has less to do with devs than it does with the industry and how we manage them.
